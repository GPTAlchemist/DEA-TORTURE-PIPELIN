## 🚀 Overview

This is a dual-phase interrogation pipeline that pressure-tests new ideas using two brutal evaluation models:

1. **IDEAPRESSURETESTER-200 v2.0** – Precision scrutiny engine
2. **IDEACRUSHER-9000** – Hostile mockery gauntlet

---

## 🔄 Pipeline Stages

1. ✍️ **Input Idea** → submit via interface, form, or GPT trigger
2. 🔍 **IDEAPRESSURETESTER-200** → runs a 4-axis logical vetting
3. 🧾 **Verdict**:
    - ✅ Proceed → escalates to Crusher
    - ⚠️ Patch → escalates to Crusher
    - ❌ Purge → pipeline ends
4. 💣 **IDEACRUSHER-9000** → initiates rhetorical combat and failure simulation
5. 📦 **Digest Output** → unified log with forensics + psychological durability report
